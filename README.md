#Plato

Welcome to the Plato repo.  

Plato is a python package built on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) with a few objectives:

1. Simplify the use of Theano with a new interface (see the tutorial).
2. Use this simplified interface to build a clean, well-tested library, containing standard components in deep learning (MLPs, DBNs, VA's, etc), so that people don't have to keep reinventing the wheel every time they do a project in deep learning.  
3. Provide a set of tools for plotting, debugging, setting up experiments, and saving results.  

If you want to learn what Plato is and how to use it, see [The Plato Tutorial](https://rawgit.com/petered/plato/master/plato_tutorial.html).  

If you want to see what learning algorithms are currently included in Plato, see [Algorithms in Plato](https://github.com/petered/plato/wiki/Algorithms-in-Plato).

If you want to learn how to set it up, read [Getting Started with Plato](https://github.com/petered/plato/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Plato).
