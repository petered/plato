"""strip outputs from an IPython Notebook

Opens a notebook, strips its output, and writes the outputless version to the original file.

Useful mainly as a git pre-commit hook for users who don't want to track output in VCS.

This does mostly the same thing as the `Clear All Output` command in the notebook UI.

Adapted from rom https://gist.github.com/minrk/6176788 to work with
git filter driver
